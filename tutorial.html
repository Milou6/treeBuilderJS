    <h1>What is TreeBuilder?</h1>

    <p>TreeBuilder is a web interface to quickly and easily draw syntactic trees. The trees can be
        exported as images or files, and reloaded into the interface as needed.</p>

    <p>TreeBuilder was created for professional linguists & linguistic students alike. Its purpose is to make
        tree-drawing easy and intuitive.</p>

    <p>Please understand that this software is <b>a work in progress</b>, and as such bugs are still to be expected. A
        dedicated button for bug reports can be found on the interface, and your help in identifying them is really
        appreciated!</p>

    <h1>Quickstart Guide</h1>

    <h2 id="sect1">Basic Branching</h2>

    <p>The canvas is the main area of the interface. You can see that it always starts with a single binary
        branch already drawn.</p>

    <p>The edges of a branch can be clicked to create new branches. By clicking on the bottom-right edge of the root
        branch, we can create a new branch :</p>

    <img class="tutoImg" src="assets/tuto1.png" alt="">

    <p>Of course, branching can be done upwards as well. By clicking on the top edge of our root branch, we create a
        left-branching node on top of it :</p>

    <img class="tutoImg" src="assets/tuto2.png" alt="">

    <p>In order to branch upwards towards the right, we simply click <b>while holding down the Shift key</b> :</p>

    <img class="tutoImg" src="assets/tuto3.png" alt="">


    <h2 id="sect2">Adjusting Branch Properties</h2>

    <p>When adding multiple branches to a tree, TreeBuilder tries to space them out appropriately. If the
        default placement is incorrect or not optimal, we have full liberty to adjust the tree to our needs.</p>

    <p>The bottom edges of a branch can be dragged to reposition that particular 'arm' (and its subtree if present) :
    </p>
    <span>
        <img class="tutoImg" src="assets/tuto4.png" alt="">
        <img class="tutoImg" src="assets/tuto5.png" alt="">
    </span>

    <p>The top edge of a branch can be dragged to adjust its position relative to its parent-branch :</p>
    <span>
        <img class="tutoImg" src="assets/tuto6.png" alt="">
        <img class="tutoImg" src="assets/tuto7.png" alt="">
    </span>


    <h2 id="sect3">Single/Three -armed Branches</h2>

    <img class="tutoImg s40" src="assets/tuto8.png" alt="">
    <p>The button panel allows us to create branches with one/three arms too :</p>
    <img class="tutoImg" src="assets/tuto9.png" alt="">


    <h2 id="sect4">Arrows</h2>

    <p>Connecting features of your syntax tree with arrows is a 3-step process :</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Select the Arrow button on the button panel</li>
        <li>Choose start of the arrow by clicking on a purple indicator next to the text box</li>
        <li>Choose end of the arrow in the same way</li>
    </ul>
    <img class="tutoImg s30" src="assets/tuto10.png" alt="">
    <img class="tutoImg s30" src="assets/tuto11.png" alt="">

    <p>Arrows have a minimum size, but can be expanded away from the tree as much as needed. To do so,
        we drag the blue circle in the corner of the arrow : </p>
    <img class="tutoImg s30" src="assets/tuto12.png" alt="">


    <p>We can re-attach the start/end of an arrow to a different text box by dragging the arrow-tip to another purple
        indicator :</p>
    <img class="tutoImg s30" src="assets/tuto13.png" alt="">



    <h2 id="sect5">Exporting & Importing Trees</h2>

    <p>TreeBuilder allows us to export a tree in two ways :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As a local JSON file</li>
        <li>As an .SVG image</li>
    </ul>

    <img class="tutoImg s50" src="assets/tuto14.png" alt="">
    <p>Exporting as a JSON file allows us to reload into the canvas a tree that we previously worked on. The
        .SVG image exports can be easily added to a Word document, by simply dragging the .SVG file into it.</p>





    <h2 id="sect6">Text Box Editing</h2>

    <p>Upon clicking on a text box, we enter text editing mode. Most standard text-editing features work
        in
        text boxes too (such as Ctrl+A to select whole text, TripleClick to select current line, etc..).</p>

    <p>The color menu surrounding the text box works based on text selection. If there is no active text selection, the
        whole
        text box will be colored. If there is a selection, only the selection will be colored :</p>

    <img class="tutoImg" src="assets/tuto15.png" alt="">
    <img class="tutoImg" src="assets/tuto16.png" alt="">

    <p>The bottom-left button of the color menu is used to strikeThrough text. StrikeThrough works on a per-line basis.
    </p>

    <p>Triangles can be added to a text box to symbolize an abstracted subtree. To do so, we right-click on the text box
        and select <b>'Toggle △'</b> from the menu. Since a triangle stands for a subtree, it can only be added to a
        text box
        without a branch below it :</p>

    <img class="tutoImg" src="assets/tuto17.png" alt="">
    <img class="tutoImg" src="assets/tuto18.png" alt="">

    <p>If the text box has multiple lines, the triangle will be placed below the first line of text.
        A triangle can be removed by selecting 'Toggle △' again from the right-click menu.</p>



    <h2 id="sect7">Adding/Removing Branches from Tree</h2>

    <p>Right-clicking on a tree branch pops up a drop-down menu. With this menu we can add a new branch in the
        middle of an existing structure, without having to re-build it from scratch :</p>

    <img class="tutoImg s30" src="assets/tuto19.png" alt="">
    <img class="tutoImg s30" src="assets/tuto20.png" alt="">

    <p>This menu can also be used to change a binary branch into a ternary one (and vice-versa), and to delete a branch
        in the middle of a structure. For the moment, branch deletion only works for branches that have one child-branch
        or less.</p>


    <h2 id="sect8">Moving Around the Canvas</h2>

    <p>We can vertically navigate the canvas by scrolling up/down, and horizontally navigate by scrolling while holding
        the Shift key.</p>

    <p>We can also reposition the canvas by simply clicking on an empty part of it and dragging the cursor.</p>
